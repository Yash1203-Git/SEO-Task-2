        <section class="mb-8">
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-600 mb-4">What is Google Analytics 4 (GA4)?</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Google Analytics 4 (GA4) represents a significant evolution in web and app analytics. Unlike its predecessor, Universal Analytics (UA), GA4 operates on an <strong class="text-blue-700">event-based data model</strong>. This means every user interaction, from a page view to a button click or video engagement, is treated as an event. This unified approach provides a more holistic view of the customer journey across various platforms, whether it's your website, iOS app, or Android app.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                This shift allows for greater flexibility and deeper insights into user behavior. Instead of session-based metrics, GA4 focuses on user engagement, offering a more nuanced understanding of how users interact with your digital properties. It's built for the future, adapting to changing privacy landscapes and providing powerful machine learning capabilities.
